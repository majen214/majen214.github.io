		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>Based out of Independence, OR is an emerging software developer  
			with the goals of launching her career into mobile app development. In pursuit of this goals 
			she started a coding bootcamp with Thinkful. As she balances working full-time as a program specialist with

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>As an emerging software developer, I am eager to learn new things not only from my coworkers
			but from other subject-matter experts in the field. As the tech world is constantly changing, there's 
			much to learn. One of my interests in pursuing tech is to integrate emerging technologies to further 
			my career in the social impact sphere. I have always been drawn to creating change agents in the work I do 
			in workforce development and education, and technology presents a great tool to create transformative change 
			on a large scale. Outside of work, I enjoy learning new instruments and Latin dances, namely Bachata, Rueda de Casino, and Salsa.
