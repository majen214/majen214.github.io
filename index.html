		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>My name is Jenny and I live in Independence, OR, a small town outside of Salem, OR and an hour away from Portland. 
			As an emerging software developer, I'm looking forward to launching my career into mobile app development by joining 
			a coding bootcamp with Thinkful. My day job consists of working full-time as a program specialist with 
			nonprofits specializing in supporting small businesses, entrepreneurship and digital skilling rural communities. 
			</p>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>As an emerging software developer, I am eager to learn new things not only from my coworkers
			but from other subject-matter experts in the field. As the tech world is constantly changing, there's 
			much to learn. One of my interests in pursuing tech is to integrate emerging technologies to further 
			my career in the social impact sphere. I have always been drawn to creating change agents in the work I do 
			in workforce development and education, and technology presents a great tool to create transformative change 
			on a large scale. 
		</p>
					
		<p> Outside of work, I enjoy learning new instruments and Latin dances. I also enjoy traveling and have been to approximately 
			17 countries so far. Below you'll see some of my recommendations of places to travel!</p>
